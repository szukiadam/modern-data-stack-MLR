## Multivocal Literature Review

[Guidelines for conducting MLRs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02553.pdf)
> “there are no systematic guidelines for conducting MLRs in computer science” [57] and “There is no explicit guideline for collecting ML [multivocal literature]” [55]. We are addressing that need in this paper.
> Grey literature = literature that is not formally published in sources such as books or journal articles

Tiers of GL:
1. 1st Tier - High outlet control/high credibility (e.g. books, magazines, white papers)i
2. 2nd Tier - Moderate outler control/Moderate credibility (e.g. News articles, presentations, videos, Q/A sites, wiki articles)
3. 3rd Tier - Low outler control/low credibility (e.g. blogs, emails, tweets)

| White literature | Grey literature | Black literature |
| ---------------  | --------------  | ---------------  |
| Journal papers | Technical reports | Ideas |
| Conference proceedings | Lectures | Concepts
| Books | Blogs | Thoughts |
| | AV media | |

> closing the gap between academic research and professional practice

> While extensive GL is available in the field of SE and the volume of GL in SE is clearly expanding on a very rapid pace (e.g., in blogs and free online books), little effort has been made to utilize such a knowledge in SE research. 

> We want to highlight that according to [81] GL is important when context has a large effect on the implementation and the outcome which is typically the case in SE [84, 85]. 

> Another guideline paper [17] suggests including GL in reviews when relevant knowledge is not reported adequately in academic articles, for validating scientific outcomes with practical experience, and for challenging assumptions in practice using academic research. 
This is my main reason to use GL. 
> It is increasingly discussed in the SE community that “contextual” information (e.g., what approach works for whom, where, when, and why?) [86-89] are critical for most of SE research topics and shall be carefully considered. Since GL sometimes provide contextual information, including them and conducting a MLR would be important.
